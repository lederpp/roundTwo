# repo contains majority of practice exercises from Introduction To Programming Using Python (1st edition) By Liang
# and was created in spite of my only 8 week programming class expecting me to absorb
# all of this in that little time. I voluntaritly chose to take this class.
# the professsor is good, as bad as i feel i did on the midterm i still feel like
# i have actually retained some of this material. its just too much in too little time.
# im slow on the uptake to begin with, but once past that i dont have limits.
# i took this class becasue i'm fucking determined to learn this side of tech, or at least
# enough to say confidently that i know it to a degree. it is fun, it makes you really think
# about problems the way you never have before.
# so now, after the midterm, this is my fuck you to programming.
# it wont beat me as cliche and lame as that sounds.
# i am now, in my free time, going through this fucking book and doing every single exercise
# Professor is awesome, and very experienced, but this way of thinking about things is soo new to me.
# it cant be done in 8 weeks, at least for me.
# heres to the properly titled project/repository, Round #2
