# Round Two!

# I voluntarily chose to take this class. It was not required but filled one of my electives outside of my
# major(Makreting) but in the business school.
# I feel I did pretty shitty on the midterm, it is a lot of information to retain in just eight weeks. Especially
# if this way of thinking is pretty new to you. No matter my grade, I WILL leave this class able to say that
# I can write basic python. Have a great professor but wish I had taken this in the fall in order to slow down the
# pace a bit.
# I am now going through the textbook and doing ALL of the end of chapter exercises for the specific chapters we have covered.
# Round Two - Fight!
